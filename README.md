# Slow Useless Lisp
A homemade lisp, written in Rust.

## Running
The project currently has the program hardcoded, *but* you can see it run that hardcoded program, or change that program yourself.
```bash
$ git clone https://www.github.com/FeistyKit/sul.git
$ cd sul
$ cargo run
```

## Requirements
Requires [rust](https://rustup.rs/) installed.

## Goals
 - [ ] As few dependencies as possible.
 - [ ] Easily put into any project.
